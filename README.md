# Uncommon TypeError in Python Division

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in Python when performing division. The error is a TypeError that occurs when attempting to divide an integer by a string. 

The `bug.py` file contains a function that attempts to handle division by zero and invalid input types. When an integer is divided by a string, a TypeError will be raised. 

The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution that includes more robust input validation to prevent the TypeError. 

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling and input validation when developing robust and reliable Python applications.
